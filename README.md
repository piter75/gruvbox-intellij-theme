# Gruvbox Intellij IDEA Themes

<!-- Plugin description -->

gruvbox by [morhetz](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) is heavily inspired by badwolf, jellybeans and solarized.

Main focus of this implementation is going to be put on Dark themes.

It is tested with macOS and new UI only.
Treat it as beta quality software!

Forked from archived [Vincent-P/gruvbox-intellij-theme](https://github.com/Vincent-P/gruvbox-intellij-theme) to add support for IDEA 2022.3+.

Forked from [K1ngjulien/gruvbox-intellij-theme](https://github.com/K1ngjulien/gruvbox-intellij-theme) to fine tune the Gruvbox implementation.

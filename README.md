# Gruvbox Intellij IDEA Themes

<!-- Plugin description -->

This themes set contains Gruvbox and Gruvbox Matrial themes. Material themes are early work in progress.

Gruvbox by [morhetz](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) is heavily inspired by badwolf, jellybeans and solarized.

Gruvbox Material by [sainnhe](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material) is a modified version of Gruvbox,
the contrast is adjusted to be softer in order to protect developers' eyes.

Main focus of this implementation is going to be put on Dark themes.

It is tested with macOS and new UI only.
Treat it as beta quality software!

Forked from archived [Vincent-P/gruvbox-intellij-theme](https://github.com/Vincent-P/gruvbox-intellij-theme) to add support for IDEA 2022.3+.

Forked from [K1ngjulien/gruvbox-intellij-theme](https://github.com/K1ngjulien/gruvbox-intellij-theme) to fine tune the Gruvbox implementation.
